/*In this project we are making a webpage that will fetch data from an json database "located locally in and API folder" to make a site
that has the capability to:
        - create new reservations
                -listed in chronological order
                *-closest date first-*

        - delete reservations from the website
*/

// ^This is to create Reserve button...

//need to build this out in the main.js, ServiceForm.js and dataAccess.js modules. ("maybe more modules need to be included to get things working.  Will update.")

// 1. Build HTML that contains input fields for all information needed to reserve a clown for a birthday (information needed below).
/*
        parentName: userParentName,
         childName: userChildName,
         partySize: userPartySize,
           address: userAddress,
          duration: userDuration,
          neededBy: serviceDate,
         description: userDescription,
*/
// 2. create function in dataAccess module to post a reservation state object to API to be saved in permanent storage

//3. Create event Listener to 
/*
  ?  - collect user input
  ?  - construct a state object for reservation
  ?  - pass it to function defined as an argument.
